## About 

Fixathon is a global hackathon for tech makers to help prevent the earth's climate from breaking down. 

It's a month-long (because Earth problems wouldn't be fixed in 2 days)  hackathon for tech professionals to use their skills to build impactful projects to help increase awareness of the climate change issue and people to take action. Any web or app-based project that aims to help restore a safe climate for our world is eligible.
It will be announced on 10th June and start on 2nd August lasting four weeks. Teams from around the world will compete in three tech climate challenges to win cash prizes.

- Awareness: Raise awareness of climate breakdown
