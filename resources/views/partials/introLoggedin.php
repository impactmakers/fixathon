        <h3>Join Our Weekly Video Chat</h3>
        <p>Online hackathons lack that IRL event buzz, so we've decided to hold a weekly Zoom call for all participants. It's a great opportunity to get to know each other, chat about your project and the climate emergency. 
        </p><p>The first one will be this Saturday 3rd August at 9:00AM CEST for 1 hour, feel free to drop in! Click here to see the time in your timezone.</p>
